        &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://nathandautenhahn.com/ndd-facultyapp/#projects">Complete List on Faculty Application Materials</a></strong><br />
        <br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Virtual Ghost: Protecting Applications from Hostile Operating Systems:</strong><br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Developed the VirtualGhost x86-64 MMU page table implementation and ported<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;FreeBSD PMAPS subsystem to utlize VirtualGhost MMU functionality. Additionally,<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;implemented MMU update verification so that the operating system is denied access<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;to maliciously modify the MMU, thereby, protecting application memory.<br /><br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>QuickRec: Prototyping an Intel Architecture Extension for Record and<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Replay of Multithreaded Programs:</strong> Designed and implemented a chunk and<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;input deterministic based replay system in a Pin tool. Simulated and successfully<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;replayed TSO relaxed memory model race conflicts. Additionally, participated in<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;debugging the Quickrec RnR prototype hardware implementation and successfully<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;found several bugs such as miscounting of instructions on floating point exceptions.<br /><br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Using Replicated Execution for a More Secure and Reliable Web Browser:</strong><br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Developed a browser extension for Firefox, Chrome, and Opera that provided core<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;functionality of an opportunistic-n-version programming approach to detecting and<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;masking browser-based exploits.<br /><br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Tor Fingerprinting Attack:</strong> Developed a passive fingerprinting attack against<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Tor network with the goal of identifying the webpage a given Tor client is viewing<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;by eavesdropping on the connection between the Tor client and Tor entry router. I<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;examined several mathematical approaches for classifying an unknown fingerprint <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;(frequency distribution of the number of packets at given sizes) to a database of<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;known websites; in the end I selected an entropy based metric â€“ Kullback-Leibler<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;divergence - which identifies how divergent a given probability distribution is from<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;another.<br /><br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Automated Intrusion Detection Investigation and Response System<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;(IDIRS):</strong> Examined the areas of intrusion detection systems, security ontologies,<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;information fusion, and alert correlation and aggregation systems. The goal was to<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;develop the necessary background to commence development of a prototype<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;automated IDS with automated response capabilities. This project led to the<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;development of a survey paper and a research proposal for an automated IDIRS.<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;The key insight of this project is that disparate data, normally thought to have no<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;relationship, can be mined for weak associations that, in the presence of other<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;correlated data, can be used to determine whether or not an attack has occurred.</p>
