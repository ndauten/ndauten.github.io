## But Security... Operating on an Untrustworthy Base

1. Layers of vulnerable code, written by too many people to
vet

--

2. Lots of it

--

3. Monolithic

--

Not clear how Docker impacts the standard security
ecosystem.

???

speak: The problem is that we are operating on an
untrustworthy computing base, not too different than the
titanic in its day. Three problems. What is also unclear is
how Docker itself changes the security threat landscape
given its need for privileges and particular methods of OS
resource virtualization. The result is an approach that has
poor fail-safe defaults, relying on bolt-on policies via
SELinux/Landlock that only capture known threat vectors. 

---

## Some Strategies: Replace or Harden and Separate

--

- Microkernel? Yes. But what about the existing used
  ecosystem? 

--

- Goal: Apply Least Privilege 

--

- Tools like SELinux, Landlock, etc.: minimize app
  privileges to known sensitive data and operations

--

- The Big Problem: What about fail-safe defaults?

---

## Limitations of Existing Approaches

--

  - rely on developer expertise

--

  - lack of visibility into the apps

--

  - only known safety critical resources

--

  - manual policy derivation

--

  - hard coded course grained abstractions

--

  - course grained ephemeral state

--

  - no kernel principles

--

  - not container aware: process based principles not best
    for OS virtualization

---

## What are threats and how can security be retrofitted?

## Challenges: Complexity, Transformation, and Protection

--

- **Abstractions**: How do you abstract and
  specify policies?

--

- **Flexible, Scalable, Systematic Policy Derivation**: 

--
    - What are the principles? objects? operations? 
--
    - How to get as non-expert?
--
    - How to protect all resources not just known critical?

--

- **Transformation**: Given suitable policy and
  abstractions, how to modify the system to behave
  accordingly?

--

- **Enforcement**: How to efficiently protect?

--

- **Compatibility**: Retrofitting can cause incompatibility, how
  do we deal with issues?

--

- **Evolution**: As threats and required privileges evolve, how
  hard is it to change the system?

---

## Overview of Projects

--

- OPS: end-to-end approach for fine-grained security policy
  retrofitting

--

- LINX: Linux Nested Kernel (similar to okernel): 

--

- kr^x: kernel randomization framework

--

- Memorizer: dynamic tracer of intra-kernel interactions

--

- SLICE: Separated Linux for Isolated and Compartmentalized
  Execution

# Opportunistic Privilege Separation (OPS) 

---
layout: true
template: default

### OPS 

---

## Hypothesis: Automatically Derive Privileges from System Behavior

--

- Mine existing behavior as if they are capabilities

--

- Build tool suite similar to an optimizing compiler along
  with efficient enforcement and controlled sharing

--

- But requires a privilege model

--

- Goal is to approximate least-privilege with strong
  fail-safe defaults

---

## Our goal is maximal separation to inform various policy platforms

--

- simple yet expressive and extensible privilege/policy model

--

- low level representation of ephemeral state

--

- minimize human in the loop

---

## Intuition through Examples

There are several elements of program state that may present
strong *and* performant separation

---

## Information and Interactions as a Unified Low Level Representation 

--

- Everything is an object

--

- Objects are basic storage abstraction, comprising a set of
  contiguous bytes (e.g., code, data, file descriptors,
  etc.)


--

- Object Operations:

--

    - Create/Destroy (alloc/free)
--
    - Read/Write
--
    - Call/Return
--

- Objects have types based on the defined allocation site
  and size


--

- Benefit: low-level yet expressive enough to capture higher
  level abstractions (SELinux policies?)

---

## Slice Separation Model through Ambient Authority

--

- On object interactions get principle information through
  ambient program state


--

- Slice is abstraction for concurrently operating security
  contexts, a multidimensional vector of separation contexts


--

- Separation Context: any useful state for valuable security
  program cuts (code location, thread instance, namespace)


--

- Extensible: easily add new context to model

---

## How do we assign initial access rights? Implicit "belongs-to" relation.

--

- Use *Object-Encapsulation* model to assign rights

--

- Based on the currently executing slice during object
  creation

---

## All that put together?

--

- Context-Aware Provenance via Memory Access Pattern Maps
  (CAPMAPS, cmaps), also capability maps


--

- Map all operations into a unified map relating actions to
  principles


--

- The core concept of Memorizer

---

layout: false
class: center, middle, inverse

# Memorizer 

---
layout: true
template: default

### Memorizer 

---

## Memorizer Architecture

<img src="memorizer-arch.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 800px;"/>

---

## Object Tracing: create/destroy

--

- Hook Linux kernel memory allocators

--

- Similar to KASAN, but did custom

--

| Allocator         | Complete |
| :---------------- |:--------:|
| kmalloc           | yes      |
| kmem_cache_alloc  | yes      |
| page_alloc        | part     |
| per_cpu           | no       |
| globals           | yes      |
| stack             | part     |
---

## Access Tracing: read/write

--

- KASAN instrument ld/st 

--

- Hook into memorizer

--

- Track access metadata

--

- Compress for memory utilization

--

- Most slowness of memorizer is here due to simplification
  in implementation

---

## Object Lookup

--

- On each access find object being written to

--

- Use custom three level lookup table (memory hog)

---

# Demo + Results

---

layout: false
class: center, middle, inverse

# Path Forward

---
layout: true
template: default

### Path Forward
---

## Status 

- call/ret tracing (attempted ftrace but lossy)

- convert to KASAN lookup; extend KASAN mapping; create
  general object lookup tracing system

- minimize inline read/write operations: work queue, but
  time windows

---

## Practical Help

- How to drive it?

- How to get data out of it?

- How to integrate DataKit CI?

- Our goal is to drive practical use case to see data: how
  to configure the linuxkit.yml?

- Testing: Drive it through as much of the kernel space as
  possible?

---

## Collaboration and Discussion

--

- Extending Memorizer to support namespaces tracking and
  analysis

--

- Docker empirical security investigation

--

- How can this be used to inform tools like SELinux or
  Landlock?

--

- Interest in a Docker security analysis?

--

- Incremental rewriting of kernel components in safer
  languages (unikernels style: full vertical slice including
  subset of Linux)?
